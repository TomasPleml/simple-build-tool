= Java Sources =

== Description ==

There is very rudimentary support for compiling Java sources in `sbt`.  It comes with almost none of the usual `sbt` features for Scala sources and is not very flexible yet.  In particular,
 * The compiler used is the `javac` on your path.
 * There is no interdependency tracking between Java sources
 * There is no tracking between Java sources and their generated class files.
 * There is no support for running tests written in Java

A scala file depending on a changed java file *will* get recompiled properly.  Nevertheless, you might want to run 'clean' before 'compile' if you change your java sources and want to be sure of correct recompilation.

== Usage ==

 * `compile` will compile the sources under `src/main/java`
 * `test-compile` will compile the sources under `src/main/java`.
 
Pass options to the Java compiler by adding instances of `JavaCompileOption` to your `compileOptions`.  For example:
{{{
  override def compileOptions = JavaCompileOption("-g:none") :: super.compileOptions.toList
}}}
