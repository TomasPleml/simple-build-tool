= Building `sbt` =

NOTE: Building `sbt` using `sbt` has changed in order to be able to build against multiple versions of Scala.

[http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/source/checkout Checkout] `sbt` from the subversion repository.

Use the latest release of `sbt` to build trunk.

== Main ==

{{{
$ sbt
> update
...
> package
...
}}}

If you want to compile against all versions `sbt` supports, use:

{{{
> cross-publish-local
}}}

This also installs these versions of `sbt` to your local Ivy repository.  Versions 0.4.1 or later of the loader can use these installed versions in your projects like normal releases.

== Loader ==

The loader is in a separate directory `boot`.  It is not yet a subproject of the main `sbt` project and so you need to run `sbt` in the `boot` directory.

{{{
sbt_home/boot $ sbt
> update
...
> proguard
...
}}}

The `sbt-launcher.jar` in the project directory (not the `target` directory) is the final output.
