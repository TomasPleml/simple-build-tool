= Building `sbt` =

== Background ==

`sbt` now uses git for version control.  You can find the source on github.  As of 0.7.2, `sbt` is at [http://github.com/harrah/xsbt].

Test support was separated out to work across a [http://github.com/harrah/test-interface uniform test interface].  Because of this, `sbt` no longer needs to be compiled against test frameworks.  New test frameworks that implement the uniform test interface can be used by `sbt` without needing to recompile `sbt`, as was the case previously.  In order to provide compatibility with `sbt` 0.5.6, there is [http://github.com/harrah/test-compat an implementation] of the test interface for Scala test frameworks released before the interface existed.

== Instructions ==

The latest `sbt` release (0.7.2) is used to build.  From scratch, building `sbt` locally looks like:
{{{
$ git clone git://github.com/harrah/xsbt.git
$ cd xsbt
$ sbt update proguard "project Simple Build Tool" publish-local
}}}
The launcher jar created by the `proguard` action is located at `xsbt/target/sbt-launch-0.7.x.jar`.

== Usage ==

Set the `sbt.version` in the project you want to use this in to be `0.7.3-SNAPSHOT`.  If you rebuild sbt, you'll need to remove `project/boot` for that project because `sbt` does not recheck a version once it is retrieved to a project.
