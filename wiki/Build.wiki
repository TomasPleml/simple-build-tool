= Building `sbt` =

NOTE: Building `sbt` using `sbt` has changed in order to be able to build against multiple versions of Scala.

[http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/source/checkout Checkout] `sbt` from the subversion repository.

Use the latest release of `sbt` to build trunk.

== Basic ==

{{{
$ sbt
> update
...
> full-build
...
}}}

This will build `sbt` against all versions of Scala that `sbt` supports and install these `sbt` variants to your local Ivy repository.  The packaged loader jar is `boot/sbt-loader.jar`.  With this loader built from trunk, you can use the trunk `sbt` in your projects like a normal release.  That is, you can set `sbt.version` to the trunk version and the loader will find it.

== Development ==

If you want to run tests, debug, or otherwise develop on `sbt`, you will want to use the usual actions like `compile` and `package`.  In addition to the usual actions, the `proguard` action builds the final loader jar `boot/sbt-launcher.jar`.
