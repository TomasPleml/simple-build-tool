= Introduction =

This page describes how to set up your project for use with sbt.
All paths are relative to your project directory.

The basic steps are:
 # Setup your source directory
 # Put libraries in `lib`
 # Create the project information file `metadata/info`
 # Create a launcher script
 # Read RunningSbt for basic usage instructions

= Directory Layout =

Sbt uses the same directory structure as maven for source files by default.

{{{
  src/
    main/
      resources/
         <files to include in main jar here>
      scala/
         <main Scala sources>
    test/
      resources
         <files to include in test jar here>
      scala/
         <test Scala sources>
}}}

Other directories in src/ will be ignored.  Additionally, `.svn` directories will be ignored.

All dependencies (jars) go in the
{{{
  lib/
}}}
directory or any subdirectory of `lib`.  Again, `.svn` directories will be ignored.  If you want to use [http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/ ScalaCheck] for testing, it should go in here as well.  You will need a version compiled with Scala 2.7.2.

The project information directory is:
{{{
  metadata/
    info
    analysis/
}}}

The `info` file provides basic project information and is described in the next section.
The `analysis` directory is where sbt will put information extracted from compilation, such as source file dependencies, mapping from source file to generated class files, and list of tests to run.

Generated files (classes, jars, and documentation) will be written to the
{{{
  target/
}}}
directory.  This directory does not need to be manually created.


= Project Information File =

The `metadata/info` file is a text file that consists of two lines.
 * The first line is your project's name.
 * The second line is your project's version.
This information is used the API documentation title and the base name of generated jars.


= Launching Sbt =

The easiest way to launch sbt is to create a one-line script.  Download `sbt.jar` if you have not already.  I will refer to the full path to `sbt.jar` as `sbt_home/sbt.jar` in the scripts.

 === Unix ===
Put the line
{{{
scala -cp sbt_home/sbt.jar sbt.Main $*
}}}
in a file called `sbt` in your `~/bin` directory and do
{{{
$ chmod u+x ~/bin/sbt
}}}
This allows you to launch sbt in any directory by typing `sbt` at the command prompt.  See RunningSbt for usage.

 === Windows ===
Create a batch file `sbt.bat`:
{{{
scala -cp sbt_home\sbt.jar sbt.Main %1
}}}
I don't run Windows so I don't know if there is a location you can put this batch file so that it is always available at the command prompt.
See RunningSbt for sbt usage instructions.
