= sbt has moved =

*sbt has now completely moved to !GitHub.*

See https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki.

= Changes from 0.5.4 to 0.5.5 =

== Features ==
 * Experimental support for searching for project (`-Dsbt.boot.search=none|only|root-first|nearest`).
 * Added support for configuring repositories on a per-module basis.
 * Can specify a specific nightly of Scala 2.8 to use when building sbt locally.  In particular, 0.5.5 is built against 2.8.0-20090929.004247-+ (no test support, however).

== Improvements ==
 * No longer need `"->default"` in configurations (automatically mapped).
 * Unified batch-style and interactive-style commands.  All commands that were previously interactive-only should be available batch-style.  'reboot' does not pick up changes to 'scala.version' properly, however.  This means you can now do:
{{{
 $ sbt "~test-quick"
}}}
 or
{{{
 $ sbt "project sub" compile
}}}
 * Can retrieve javadocs and sources using `withJavadocs()` and `withSources()` methods on dependencies.  To get only javadocs and/or sources, use `javadocs() `or `sources()`.

== Fixes ==
 * Fixed problem with classifier support and the corresponding test
 * Fix issue where last path component of local repository was dropped if it did not exist.
