= Webstart =

A webstart project is used to generate outputs for [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/developersguide/contents.html Java Webstart].  To create a webstart project, extend `DefaultWebstartProject` instead of extending `DefaultProject`.  The only method required to be defined is:
 * `jnlpXML` - Inline XML [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html JNLP file]

Other methods of interest include:
 * `webstartSignConfiguration` - Configures signing.  If it is `None` (the default), signing jars is disabled.  Otherwise, it is contains an instance of `SignConfiguration`.
 * `webstartPack200` - When `true`, enables [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/pack200.html Pack200] compression of jars.  This is enabled by default.
 * `webstartGzip` - When `true`, enables gzip compression of jars.  This is enabled by default.

See the [http://simple-build-tool.googlecode.com/svn/artifacts/latest/api/sbt/WebstartOptions.html WebstartOptions] API documentation for more options.

A webstart project generates its output when `package` is executed.  The output is by default put in `target/webstart` and produces a zip of that directory.  You can add a web application project to test it out.  An example project definition is shown on the [WebstartExample Webstart Example] page.
