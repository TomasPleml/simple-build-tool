#summary Depending on another SBT Project

It is possible to declare a declare a dependency on another SBT project, similar to jar dependencies, by defining a val in your project configuration file. You must specify the path at which the project can be found.

{{{
val util = project("util")
}}}

A project dependency will be built when the depending project is built, and its classpath will be available; see [SubProjects] for more details. 

Note that there are some other variants of the {{{project()}}} method  which override the configuration of the referenced project when it is loaded (ie they ignore the contents of its project/build directory). See the [http://simple-build-tool.googlecode.com/svn/artifacts/latest/api/sbt/Project.html Project API] for details.
