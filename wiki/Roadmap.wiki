== Introduction ==

This is the roadmap to a first release.  The current work is various improvements to existing features and adding support for other testing frameworks.  The other two major categories of work remaining are documentation and testing.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

== Improvements ==

This list describes improvements/fixes to existing features.

 * Parallel execution
  * Make output of `compile`, `doc`, and `test` actions compatible with parallel execution (need to buffer output)
 * Conditional execution has been generalized and could be applied to documentation generation, test execution, preprocessor, etc...
 * Library dependency management
  * Improve/fix handling of Ivy configurations
 * Either improve `Version` or allow arbitrary version strings

== Features ==

 * Test execution
  * Support for other testing frameworks (ScalaTest, specs, ...)

== Documentation ==

 * API Documentation, especially:
  * Project and subclasses
