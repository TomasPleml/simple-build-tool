= Web Applications =

This page describes some features of `sbt` that are useful for developing web applications.

== Basic Usage ==

Instead of extending `sbt.DefaultProject` in your project definition, extend `sbt.DefaultWebProject`.  This currently does two things.  First, the `package` action creates a war file instead of a jar file.  Second, if you add [http://jetty.mortbay.com/ Jetty] as a dependency (manually or automatically), you can use `jetty-run` to start your web application from `sbt`.  Use `jetty-stop` to stop it.  If you are running in batch mode, use the `jetty` action, which will wait for a key press before completing.

== Configuration ==

`sbt` uses the directory structure of Maven by default, so your web application files should go in `src/main/webapp` by default.  You can override `webappPath` to change this.  If you need to include extra files in your web application, override `extraWebappFiles` with a `PathFinder` that selects the extra files that you want (see [Paths] for information on `PathFinder`).  To change the port Jetty starts up on, override `jettyPort`.

== Continuous Redeployment ==

You can also continuously recompile and reload the web application when using Jetty:
{{{
> jetty-run
> ~ prepare-webapp
}}}
`jetty-run` starts Jetty and the `~ prepare-webapp` recompiles and recreates the web application whenever sources files change (see TriggeredExecution for details on `~`).  The `jetty-run` action monitors the directories given by `scanDirectories` and redeploys on changes.  By default, the entire temporary web application directory is monitored.  You might want to change `scanDirectories` in some cases.  For example, set `scanDirectories` to `Nil` if you do not want to redeploy on changes.  Or, set `scanDirectories` to only monitor the library and classes directories:
{{{
  override def scanDirectories = ( temporaryWarPath / "WEB-INF" / ("classes" | "lib") ).get.toSeq
}}}
You might use one of these options if your web application picks up changes to resource files and therefore does not need to be redeployed or if you are using [http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/ JRebel].

Another possibility is to directly run the web application out of the the source web application path:
{{{
  override def jettyWebappPath  = webappPath
  override def scanDirectories = mainCompilePath :: testCompilePath :: Nil
}}}

== Example ==

A minimal project definition might be:

{{{
class WebappBuild(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultWebProject(info)
{
  val jetty6 = "org.mortbay.jetty" % "jetty" % "6.1.14" % "test"  // jetty is only need for testing
}
}}}

For a runnable example, see the [WebApplicationExample] page, which describes running the Hello Lift example with `sbt`.

== `JRebel` ==

To use JRebel, override `scanDirectories` as described above so that `sbt` does not reload Jetty on changes to your classes.  Pass the following options to `java` in your `sbt` startup script:

{{{
-noverify -javaagent:/path/to/jrebel/jrebel.jar
}}}
