= Method Tasks =

As shown in several examples on the [TriggeredExecution Triggered Execution] page, a method task accepts an array of arguments and creates the task to be run from those arguments.  Usage of a method task from the interactive prompt looks like:
{{{
> run 10000 5 0.3
}}}
or
{{{
> test-only example.TestSpecification
}}}

Defining your own method task is similar to defining a normal action, as shown in the following example.
{{{
lazy val example =
   task { args =>
     if(args.length == 2)
       actionConstructor(args(0).toInt, args(1))
     else
       task { Some("Usage: example <integer> <string>") }
   }
def actionConstructor(a: Int, b: String) =
    task {
      println("Arguments were: " + a + " and " + b)
      None
    }
}}}
The type of `args` is `Array[String]`.

You can then call `example` like:
{{{
> example 5 text
Arguments were: 5 and text
}}}

Additionally, you can use quotes to include whitespace in arguments.  Quotes must be escaped (`\"`) and so must backslashes (`\\`):
{{{
> example "5" "Text with \"spaces\" and a backslash \\ included."
Arguments were: 5 and Text with "spaces" and a backslash \ included.
}}}

You can provide strings for basic tab completion for method tasks using the `completeWith` method.

{{{
  def testNames: Seq[String] = ...

  lazy val myTestOnly =
    task { args => ... } completeWith( testNames )
}}}


The argument to `completeWith` is call-by-name and is re-evaluated after a command is run.
