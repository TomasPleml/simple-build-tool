<dl>
<dt>Problem</dt>
<dd>*The compiler cannot find classes*</dd>
<dt>Solution</dt>
<dd>Ensure the classes are on the classpath.  You need to run `update` if you have declared managed dependencies.  Unmanaged jars should go in `lib/` by default.</dd>
<dt>Discussion</dt>
<dd>You can use [ProjectConsole console-project] to list the contents of classpaths.  Check that the expected jars exist and contain the classes you want.  You can also use [RunningSbt#Build_Actions javap] for this purpose.

A common cause is forgetting to run `update`.  See the documentation on [Classpaths classpaths] and [ManagedDependencies managing dependencies] for more information.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Problem</dt>
<dd>*Corrupted download of sbt or Scala*</dd>
<dt>Solution</dt>
<dd>Restart sbt after deleting:
 * `~/.m2/repository`
 * `~/.ivy2/cache`
 * `project/boot`
</dd>
<dt>Discussion</dt>
<dd>While this should not normally be necessary assuming Ivy is doing its job properly, removing these directories will reset things to a clean state so you can be sure whatever problem isn't being caused by corrupt or stale cached files.  If you find yourself doing this repeatedly, please report the issue.</dd>
