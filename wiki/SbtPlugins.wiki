 = sbt Plugins =

This page describe `sbt` plugins.  The first part shows the results of a plugin that creates a self-extracting jar out of a project.   The second part shows how to create a simple plugin that provides a new action to a project.

== Installer Example ==

 * Download the [http://simple-build-tool.googlecode.com/svn/artifacts/0.5.1/examples/hello-lift-1.0-setup.jar jar]
 * Run `java -jar hello-lift-1.0-setup.jar` .  The Hello Lift project and an embedded `sbt` launcher will be extracted.  The project will be loaded and predefined actions run.  In this case, the project will be set up, dependencies will be downloaded, and the project will be compiled and Jetty started.  Browse to [http://localhost:8080].  Due to current limitations of the installer, the session must be killed with Ctrl+C when you are finished.
 * You have a ready example Lift project.  For example, you can enter the extracted project directory and start sbt with `java -jar sbt-launcher-0.5.1.jar`.
 * The project uses [http://github.com/harrah/browse/ Scala X-Ray] to generate browsable sources.  You can view these in the `project/target/classes.sxr` directory.
 * You can run `installer` to regenerate the self-extracting jar from the project.  Note: there is currently the issue of including the sbt-launcher in the project zip, making the jar substantially larger than necessary.
 * See the `project/plugins/Plugins.scala` directory for how the plugin is defined.  The actual project for the plugin is at [http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/source/browse/#svn/trunk/install].
 
== Hello World Plugin ==

To try out plugins, we'll make a simple hello world plugin and use it.

=== Make the Plugin ===

To make a plugin, create a new project with a project definition that extends `PluginProject`.  This can now go in `project/build`.  The basic example:

{{{
  import sbt._
  class TestPluginProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends PluginProject(info)
}}}

Make a simple plugin by putting the following in `src/main/scala` :

{{{
package hw
import sbt._
trait HelloWorldPlugin extends Project {
  lazy val hello = task { log.info("Hello World!"); None }
}
}}}

Publish it by running the `publish-local` action.

=== Use the Plugin ===

To use the plugin, create a new project.  Declare plugins by putting a plugin definition (basically a project definition that extends `PluginDefinition`) in `project/plugins/`.  The following example assumes that the plugin above had was setup with the name "test" and with version "1.0".

{{{
class Plugins(info: ProjectInfo) extends PluginDefinition(info) {
  val a = "test" % "test" % "1.0"
}
}}}

Define the project definition in `project/build/` to use the `HelloWorldPlugin` :

{{{
class TestProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultProject(info) with hw.HelloWorldPlugin
}}}

Try it out by running the `hello` action at the prompt.
