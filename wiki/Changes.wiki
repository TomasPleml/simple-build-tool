=== 0.1.4 to 0.1.5 ===

 * Generalized interface with plugin (see `AnalysisCallback`)
 * Split out task implementations and paths from `Project` to `ScalaProject`
 * Subproject support (changed required project constructor signature: see `sbt/DefaultProject.scala`)
  * Can specify dependencies between projects
  * Execute tasks across multiple projects
  * Classpath of all dependencies included when compiling
  * Proper inter-project source dependency handling
  * Can change to a project in an interactive session to work only on that project (and its dependencies)
 * External dependency handling
  * Tracks non-source dependencies (compiled classes and jars)
  * Requires each class to be provided by exactly one classpath element (This means you cannot have two versions of the same class on the classpath, e.g. from two versions of a library)
  * Changes in a project propagate the right source recompilations in dependent projects
  * Consequences:
   * Recompilation when changing java/scala version
   * Recompilation when upgrading libraries (again, as indicated in the second point, situations where you have library-1.0.jar and library-2.0.jar on the classpath at the same time are not handled predictably.  Replacing library-1.0.jar with library-2.0.jar should work as expected.)
   * Changing sbt version will recompile project definitions

=== 0.1.3 to 0.1.4 ===

 * Autodetection of Project definitions.
 * Simple tab completion/history in an interactive session with JLine
 * Added descriptions for most actions

=== 0.1.2 to 0.1.3 ===

 * Dependency management between tasks and auto-discovery tasks.
 * Should work on Windows.

=== 0.1.1 to 0.1.2 ===

 * Should compile/build on Java 1.5
 * Fixed run action implementation to include scala library on classpath
 * Made project configuration easier (see BuildConfiguration in the Wiki)

=== 0.1 to 0.1.1 ===

 * Fixed handling of source files without a package
 * Added easy project setup
